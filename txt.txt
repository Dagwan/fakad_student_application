now that my api is working sucessfully, i need the application page, home page, about us, contactus, our service with any other pages you think will be okay for computer business centre like cafe. additionally, i want to use html 5, latest css, and react technologies for the frontend. i need it step by step one after anothr so i will understand evertyhing. if needed i need some bootstrapes or any other technologies that will make my page intereactive and provessional for my client.
i like the step by step but this is too much. can we do it one by one? when i finish i'll then let you that am done so we can move to the nex how about that? let start with how i'll set up my folder structure which folder will be whic and which will be. then next you'll ask me to into this folder... and put the code.... i don't know if you understand me? am using windows and vs code hp windows 10. can i integrate the frontend into the node api base on what we have done so far? remember already have a folder name "fakad_student_application" where it contains all my api code like controllers/fakadController.js, db/db.js, models/fakadModel.js, node_modules, routes/fakadRoutes.js, routes/index.js, routes/swagger.js, .evn, .eslintrc.json, .gitignore, .prettierrc, fakad.json, package-lock.json, package.json, procfile, readme.md, routes.rest, server.js, swagger.js, and swagger.json. if am to implement the frontend, it's it possible to include it in the api "fakad_student_application"?
